The variables inside a interface are final and static in nature and must be initialized inside the interface.


After JDK 8, we can have default concrete methods in an interface. It is also called extension methods. The implementations of this type of methods by a class that immplements the interface is optional.

Example)

public interface MyIF{
int getNumber(); // traditional interface methods

default String getString(){

return "Default String";
}

}


After JDK 8, interface can also have static methods. To call it, we have to use: interfacename.staticmethodname;
Static interface methods are not inherited by either an implementing class or a subinterface.
